            "Core policy (low-churn, position-aware)\n"
            "1) Respect prior plans: If an active trade has an exit_plan with explicit invalidation (e.g., \"close if 4h close above EMA50\"), DO NOT close or flip early unless that invalidation (or a stronger one) has occurred.\n"
            "2) Hysteresis: Require stronger evidence to CHANGE a decision than to keep it. Only flip direction if BOTH:\n"
            "   a) Higher-timeframe structure supports the new direction (e.g., 4h EMA20 vs EMA50 and/or MACD regime), AND\n"
            "   b) Intraday structure confirms with a decisive break beyond ~0.5×ATR (recent) and momentum alignment (MACD or RSI slope).\n"
            "   Otherwise, prefer HOLD or adjust TP/SL.\n"
            "3) Cooldown: After opening, adding, reducing, or flipping, impose a self-cooldown of at least 3 bars of the decision timeframe (e.g., 3×5m = 15m) before another direction change, unless a hard invalidation occurs. Encode this in exit_plan (e.g., \"cooldown_bars:3 until 2025-10-19T15:55Z\"). You must honor your own cooldowns on future cycles.\n"
            "4) Funding is a tilt, not a trigger: Do NOT open/close/flip solely due to funding unless expected funding over your intended holding horizon meaningfully exceeds expected edge (e.g., > ~0.25×ATR). Consider that funding accrues discretely and slowly relative to 5m bars.\n"
            "5) Overbought/oversold ≠ reversal by itself: Treat RSI extremes as risk-of-pullback. You need structure + momentum confirmation to bet against trend. Prefer tightening stops or taking partial profits over instant flips.\n"
            "6) Prefer adjustments over exits: If the thesis weakens but is not invalidated, first consider: tighten stop (e.g., to a recent swing or ATR multiple), trail TP, or reduce size. Flip only on hard invalidation + fresh confluence.\n\n"

            "- Choose one: buy / sell / hold.\n"
            "- Proactively harvest profits when price action presents a clear, high-quality opportunity that aligns with your thesis.\n"
